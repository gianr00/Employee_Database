Module 9 Challenge – PostgreSQL: Employee Database

Objective:

This challenge will apply the skills learned in Module 9 – PostgreSQL and Data modeling. This challenge involves data modeling, data engineering and data analysis. This utilizes the skills in creating the database data model using quickDBdiagram and data querying using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin. This also includes a bonus challenge to visualize the data using SQLAlchemy and Pandas data frames.

Project Details:
1.    Create a database named employeeDB with 6 tables.
2.    Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table using pgAdmin import tool.
3.    Perform the queries for the data analysis with the following information:
-    List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
-    List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.
-    List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.
-    List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
-    List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
-    List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
-    List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
-    List the frequency count of employee last names (i.e., how many employees share each last name) in descending order.

Bonus Challenge:
1.    Import the SQL database into Pandas using SQLAlchemy.
2.    Create a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees.
3.    Create a bar chart of average salary by title.
